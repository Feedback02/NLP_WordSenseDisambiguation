<h1>NLP Word Sense Disambiguation Repository</h1>

<p>This repository contains an NLP project focused on solving the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) Problem, specifically addressing both the coarse-grained and fine-grained sense disambiguation challenges.</p>

<h2>Word Sense Disambiguation Problems</h2>

<h3>Coarse-Grained Word Sense Disambiguation</h3>

<p>Coarse-grained WSD deals with the disambiguation of a word among a set of broadly categorized
homonymy-cluster that are highly distinguishable:
Imagine a scenario where a word has multiple
meanings, but these meanings fall under a small
number of distinct clusters. In this context, the
task of selecting the appropriate cluster becomes
less intricate, as the choice is limited to these distinct groups.</p>

<h3>Fine-Grained Word Sense Disambiguation</h3>

<p>In the fine-grained WSD takes the
challenge to a deeper level. Here we want to find
the gold meaning among the meanings of the word
that often differ only by a shade of context. This
fine-grained disambiguation demands a more sophisticated approach..</p>


<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To explore the implementations and methodologies for solving both coarse-grained and fine-grained Word Sense Disambiguation problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository to your local machine:
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Feedback02/NLP_WordSenseDisambiguation.git</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Open and explore the Jupyter notebooks (<code>common-baseline.ipynb</code> and <code>ModelTraining.ipynb</code>) using Jupyter Notebook or a compatible environment.</li>
  <li>Follow the instructions within the notebooks to understand the approaches and methodologies used for solving the Word Sense Disambiguation problem.</li>
</ol>

<p>Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to suit your specific requirements and enhance the project.</p>
